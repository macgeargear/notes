## CRYPTOLOGY

> The scientific study of cryptography and cryptanalysis. [Wikipedia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptology)

Cryptology is the science of secret messages. Therefore, anything that has to do with making or breaking codes falls into cryptology’s domain.

## CRYPTOGRAPHY

> Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.

People often lazily use [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) in place of the word cryptology, but in reality, cryptography focuses only on creating secure cryptosystems. For example, the design of RSA would have been cryptography work.

## CRYPTANALYSIS

> You use [Cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis) to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.

Cryptanalysis is the inverse of cryptography. It's the study of how to _break_ secret codes, not _make_ them. Having a solid understanding of cryptanalysis is fundamental in cryptography, however, as one must know their enemy.

## HONORABLE MENTION – CRYPTOCURRENCY

> A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and also verify the transfer of assets. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)

In the past few years, the slang term “crypto” has been hijacked. It used to mean cryptography or cryptanalysis but has recently come to be understood as cryptocurrency.
