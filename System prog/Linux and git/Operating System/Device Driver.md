- OS plug-in module for controlling a paticular device
- A **device driver** is a program that controls the operation of a specific type of device (e.g. printer, keyboard, mouse, etc.) that is part of a computer system.

Drivers extend the functionality of an OS.

### Installing device drivers
Typically, drivers are installed using software that is built into the OS, or where necessary downloaded from the internet.

###### Example
when **key board** is connected to a cumputer, the operatin system will detect the model of the keyboard and download the suitable driver from the manufacturere's website.

System with specialist hardware might need to install device drivers from physical storage media, such as a CD provided by the manufacturer.

if a specific device driver either not be found or not be installed, the OS may load a generic device driver. A generic device may not be as well-suited to the device as a specific device driver.
 - The generic device driver may be missing features that the specific device would provide
 - The operation of a generic device driver may be inefficient ( the computer system's performance would slow down)

Example, a gaming mouse includes extra buttons that perform specific functions. Without a specific device driver, the mouse is likely to still perform basic functionality such as the movement of the cursor around the screen as well as the normal funcitonality of the left and right mouse buttons. The additional buttons added to the ouse, however, would be unlikely to work or perform their desired function.
