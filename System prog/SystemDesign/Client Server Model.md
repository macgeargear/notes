### Client

-   A machine or process that requests data or service from a server.
-   A single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database

### Server

-   A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls.

---

### Client-Server Model

-   The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients requesting data or service from servers and servers providing data or service to clients.

---

### IP Address

-   An address given to each machine connected to the public internet.
    -   127.0.0.1: localhost
    -   192.168.x.y: Your private network. Ex, you machine and all machines on your private network will usually have the 192.168 prefix.

### PORT

-   In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the same machine without colliding, they pick a **port** to listen on.
-   A port is an integer between 0-65,535(2^16).
-   Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for _system_ ports (also called well-known ports) and shouldnâ€™t be used by user-level processes. Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and although you usually wonâ€™t be required to have them memorised, they can sometimes come in handy.
    -   22: Secure Shell
    -   53: DNS lookup
    -   80: HTTP
    -   443: HTTPS

### DNS

-   stand for Domain Name System
-   describes the entities and protocols involved in the translation from domain names to IP Addresses.
-   Typically, machines make a DNS query to a well known entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones) of the requested domain name in the response.
